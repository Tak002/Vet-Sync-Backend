# Coding Style Guidelines

These are stable, language-agnostic conventions.
Specific formatting rules may evolve.

## General
- Code should be readable without additional explanation
- Prefer explicitness over cleverness
- Avoid unnecessary abstraction

## Naming
- Use meaningful, intention-revealing names
- Avoid abbreviations unless widely accepted
- Method names should describe *what* they do, not *how*

## Structure
- Keep methods short and focused
- One method should have one responsibility
- Avoid deep nesting when possible

## Comments
- Comment *why*, not *what*
- Do not explain obvious code
